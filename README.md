## Why I built this app and what it offers.

For me, to mitigate the feeling of being an imposter, I need something, anything, to build and work towards. And what matters is not how fast I am working towards that, but that I simply just do, because failing is better than never trying. With this app, I would like to share my approach to dealing with my self-doubt and to enable other people to try it out for themselves. Here is the functionality the app offers:

### Learn what imposter syndrome is.

Get started by learning what imposter syndrome is, if it affects you, and what can be done to better deal with it. You can also figure out what type of imposter syndrome you may have.

### Plan and keep track of your milestones throughout the year.

Milestones are the things you want to work on. In this app, milestones aren't things you want to reach eventually; milestones are specific activities you do to reach your goals. You can plan when you want to work on a certain milestone, and in an overview, you can keep track of past, present, and future milestones.

### Attribute your success to the work you put into achieving those milestones.

The most important step in using Milestones is to log your progress for each milestone. This allows you to reflect on the things you have done and the progress you made throughout the year.

### Share your work and achievements.

The last step is to be proud of yourself for the milestones you have finished. Some will be successful, and some will fail. You will learn and grow from both. This makes it all the more important to share where you have put your effort and what you took away from each of those experiences.
